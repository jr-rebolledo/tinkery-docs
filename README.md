## Quick Setup Instructional Guide for Tinkery

Tinkery is an intelligent analytical warehouse designed for non-technical users in fields like customer experience, marketing, and sales. This guide will walk you through the steps of setting up Tinkery and using its features for the first time.

#### Step 1: Sign Up and Log In
Sign Up: Navigate to Tinkery's homepage and click on the "Sign Up" button. Follow the prompts to create your account.
Log In: After confirming your email, log into Tinkery using your credentials.

#### Step 2: Connect or Upload Your Data
Connect Data: Choose to connect your data from various sources (e.g., CRM, marketing platforms, or sales databases) by following the on-screen prompts.
Upload Data: Alternatively, upload files directly into Tinkery. Supported formats include CSV, JSON, and Excel.
Receive success notification: Once the connection to your data source is achieved, or your file located and uploaded, a confirmation message will appear.

#### Step 3: Create Data Domain Projects
Name Your Project: Try to name your project something that reflects what the project is trying to achieve.
Eg. A project trying to understand customer lifetime value per industry could be called, “CLV per Industry”.
Provide Context: Once connected or uploaded, Tinkery will ask you to describe the data (e.g., "This dataset contains customer purchase history" or "Marketing campaign performance"). This context helps Tinkery create metadata for better analysis.
Select Data: This is where Tinkery allows you to organize and contextualize your data sources. Go through the list of data sources available, and locate the files, tables, collections that you want to add to this project. Add natural language descriptions to each of your datasets. These should be descriptions of what those tables and files contain.
Eg. “This table contains all vehicles driving into the main factories plants in the past 3 years, it holds times they entered and exited as well as specific details of the vehicles”
Build Relationships: Tinkery will now automatically create relationships between them using context-driven ontologies. All this data will allow you to explore, query, visualize and predict data.
Review Ontologies: These relationships will be stored as ontologies, which you can later use to query and transform your data. These will be displayed for you in the project creation wizard and can be manually edited.

#### Step 4: Generate Metadata
Tinkery's AI: Using foundational models, Tinkery automatically generates metadata for your connected or uploaded data. This metadata will later help in data cleaning, analysis, and creating relations between datasets. You can choose to allow Tinkery to create domain related features which can be invaluable for further analysis.

#### Step 5: Clean and Modify Data
Explore Data: Once the metadata is generated, you can begin cleaning your data in Tinkery’s AI interface.
Identify Issues: Tinkery can identify missing or bad-quality data.
Modify Data: Accept Tinkery's suggestions for best practices in cleaning the data (e.g., filling missing fields or correcting inconsistencies). If you are not sure how to proceed with your data cleaning, just ask Tinkery.
Manual Adjustments: You can also manually modify your data where necessary, following the suggested best practices.

#### Step 6: Query, Explore, and Transform Your Data
Natural Language Interface: Use Tinkery’s natural language interface to query your data. For example, you can ask, "Show me the top 10 customers by purchase amount last quarter," and Tinkery will generate a response based on the data relationships it has created.
Explore: Dive deeper into your data by asking follow-up questions or refining your queries. Exploring is more about you figuring what you want to ask, Tinkery will make you forget about the how.
Transform: Apply transformations to your data using natural language commands, allowing you to extract actionable insights. Leveraging features already created or building new ones, you can transform your data into new valuable datasets.

#### Step 7: Leverage Metadata Across Services
The metadata generated by Tinkery can be leveraged by other services in your organization, making it easier to integrate and collaborate across teams.

#### Step 8: Collaborate and Share Insights
Collaborate: Share data projects and insights with other team members. Tinkery’s intuitive interface allows for easy collaboration without needing technical expertise.
Export Results: Export your analysis and visualizations to share reports with stakeholders or other departments.
